<h3>Data description</h3>
<p>The <strong>ATC pre-departure delay</strong> is the additional time that the aircraft is held at the stand
to avoid queuing at the departure runway.
It is a proxy of the delay which an aircraft ready to leave its gate can be subject to,
at its origin airport, due to airports constraints, demand/capacity imbalances known prior
to off-blocks, take-off restrictions and/or traffic intensity at the time of operations.
It is however to be acknowledged that this indicator does not aim at filtering out
push-back delays when these are generated by an apron management unit which is not under
the control of the ANS provider.</p>
<p>The ATC pre-departure delay is a performance indicator which will be collected for
performance monitoring only, at national level with a breakdown at airport level.</p>
<p>This performance indicator is further defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“(i) the indicator is the average ATC pre-departure delay per outbound IFR flight;</em></li>
<li><em>(ii) the indicator includes all IFR flights taking-off at the departure airport and
covers delays in start up due to air traffic control constraints when the aircraft is ready
to leave the departure stand;</em></li>
<li><em>(iii) the indicator is calculated for the whole calendar year and for each year of
the reference period.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The causes for ATC pre-departure delay means the standard IATA delay codes as defined in Section F of the
Central Office for Delay Analysis (CODA) Digest Annual 2011 ‘Delays to Air Transport in Europe’, with the duration of the delay.
These delay causes relate to IATA delay Code 89 that aims at capturing off-block delays due
to local ATC and push-back when the aircraft is ready to leave its stand.
More specifically, these codes aim at reporting restrictions at airport of departure,
including Air Traffic Services, start-up and pushback, airport and/or runway closed due
to obstruction or weather, industrial action, staff shortage, political unrest,
noise abatement, night curfew, special flights.</p>
<p>Where several causes may be attributable to flight delays, a list of those causes shall be provided.</p>

<h3>Quality documentation</h3>

<div id="quality-management" class="section level2">
<h2>Quality Management</h2>
<p>As per SES legislation,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data providers shall take
the necessary measures to ensure the quality, validation and timely transmission of the data,
including providing evidence of their quality checks and validation processes, explanations
in response to specific requests from the Commission regarding the quality of the data and,
where necessary, action plans to improve data quality.
The data shall be provided free of charge, in electronic form where applicable,
using the format specified by the Commission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The limitation of taxonomy and usage of IATA Code 89 has been acknowledged since many years.
As an example, it is currently impossible to detect late push-back approval issued by
an apron management body if it is not under ANS provider’s responsibility.</p>
<p>The use of IATA delay sub-codes significantly improves the reporting accuracy.
IATA delay sub-codes were introduced in the AHM731 (Airport Handling Manual) in 2011
and cater for more detailed reporting of ATC and reactionary delays.
These sub-codes are already in use at some airports such as Dusseldorf and London Luton.</p>
<p>Data accuracy varies considerably across airports and airlines depending on the procedures
which are in place to control the quality of Code 89 allocation.
Both airports and airlines are encouraged to set up a clear process for appropriate allocation of Code 89 delay causes.</p>
<p>Although data providers are responsible for data quality, the EUROCONTROL
Performance Review Unit performs data validation and quality checks.</p>
<div id="quality-assurance" class="section level3">
<h3>Quality assurance</h3>
<p>Data validation is performed by the Central Office for Delay Analysis (CODA), on behalf of PRU, on each data delivery
by airports and airlines, and data validation report are returned to the data providers.</p>
</div>
<div id="quality-assessment" class="section level3">
<h3>Quality assessment</h3>
<p>Raw data is cross-checked with various sources (CODA, ANSP’s, airport operators,
airport coordinators and air carriers).
A threshold is established for data coverage,
and data that does not pass the quality threshold is rejected.</p>
