## Statistical presentation

### Data description

#### ref. EASA Annex to ED Decision 2014 / 035 / R
* [AMC9 SKPI Just Culture reporting at State level](https://easa.europa.eu/document-library/agency-decisions/ed-decision-2014035r)
* [AMC10 SKPI Just Culture reporting at ANSP level](https://easa.europa.eu/document-library/agency-decisions/ed-decision-2014035r)


**Reporting of Just culture|Just Culture (JC)** aims at identifying possible obstacles and
impediments to the application of Just Culture. 

Just culture means a culture in which front line operators or others are not punished for actions,
omissions or decisions taken by them that are commensurate with their experience and training,
but where gross negligence, willful violations and destructive acts are not tolerated.

In accordance with EU legislation, States and [ANSP]s are required to complete a questionnaire
which measures the level of presence and corresponding level of absence of Just Culture.

A detailed description of the indicator and data requirements are available from the
[EASA Acceptable Means of Compliance and Guidance Material (EASA AMC/GM)](https://easa.europa.eu/document-library/acceptable-means-of-compliance-and-guidance-materials/skpi-amcgm-issue-2#SKPI). <br>

**Disclaimer**<br>
Just Culture is studied for the first time at European level. 

The PRB and EASA acknowledge that the JC definition provided in EU IR691 / 2010 is just one of
the available definitions of JC.


### Classification system
The JC indicator is determined at State and [ANSP] level.

The areas surveyed in the questionnaire are: 

* policy and its implementation, 
* legal/judiciary, and occurrence reporting; and,  
* and investigation. 

The questions are answered with "yes" or "no" in order to reveal obstacles and impediments
in each of the three areas. 



### Sector coverage

The measures pertain to the [Air Transport and Air Traffic Management Sector][air-stats]
of the economy. 


### Statistical concepts and definitions

The metrics are based on two questionnaires (State and ANSP level) published in the
[EASA AMC/GM documents](https://easa.europa.eu/document-library/acceptable-means-of-compliance-and-guidance-materials/skpi-amcgm-issue-2#SKPI).

|                                   | Policy and its implementation   | Legal/judiciary | Occurrence reporting and investigation |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| [ State level Questionnaire][slQ] | 9 questions                     | 7 questions     | 2 questions |
| [ ANSP level questionnaire][alQ]  | 13 questions                    | 3 questions     | 8 questions |


For each answer justification and evidence should be provided in order to better understand and
assess possible obstacles and impediments to the application of JC. 

Additionally to the questionnaires, States and ANSPs may report on Just culture using the
following formats: 

* [GM13 SKPI - Just culture - Reporting and Verification at State level][slQ]; and, 
* [GM14 SKPI - Just culture - Reporting and Verification at ANSP level][alQ].

It is expected that each certified provider completes the ANSP JC questionnaire,
with exception of those who avail all the air navigation services to other certified ANSPs
in accordance with Article 10 of (EC) 550 / 2004.

NSAs are required to gather information on JC from appropriate entities in the State
(e.g. Minister of Transport, Justice Department) to complete the State questionnaire.

## Release policy

### Release calendar
Typically information is released annually in in June of the following year.
 

### Release calendar access
Not applicable.

### User access
Information is disseminated to the general public via the [SES Data Portal][ses-portal]. 



## Frequency of dissemination
Information is disseminated on a yearly basis as soon as the data is verified.


## Dissemination format
Information is disseminated to the general public via the [SES Data Portal][ses-portal]. 

## Accessibility of documentation

Documentation on methodology is available at
[EASA Acceptable means of compliance and guidance material](https://easa.europa.eu/document-library/acceptable-means-of-compliance-and-guidance-materials/skpi-amcgm-issue-2#SKPI).


## Quality Management

The legal framework for quality management is established by EU legislation. 

### Quality assurance
EASA verifies both NSAs and ANSPs questionnaires through desktop audits.
The PRB is involved in some EASA verifications through temporary participation of PRU staff.

For each State, EASA verifies the State's questionnaire, the questionnaire completed by
the largest ANSP and one additional ANSP randomly chosen.

The quality assurance includes, inter alia, the following processes:

* verification of the legal references using the national gazette website,
* cross-check with data available in external sources (e.g. the Network Manager and/or EUROCONTROL),
* cross-check with information published in States's or ANSP's website.

Further, EASA will conduct a verification on the qualitative analyses which have been submitted by
States and ANSPs through the tables contained in AMC 9 SKPI and AMC 10 SKPI.

### Quality assessment

The NSAs are responsible to verify the questionnaires completed by ANSPs and to report results
of the verification to EASA.
There are at least two types of NSA organisation for verifying the questionnaires:
either there is a specific organisation or the existing oversight organisation is used to
verify the questionnaire.
The uniformity of NSA verification output across Europe is maintained through:

* the [AMC/GM material published by EASA](https://easa.europa.eu/document-library/acceptable-means-of-compliance-and-guidance-materials/skpi-amcgm-issue-2#SKPI);
* the FAQ EASA web-page;
* the EASA helpdesk; and,
* the organisation of workshops and/or bilateral meetings.

## Relevance

The information is published for performance monitoring purposes in accordance with the
relevant EU legislation. 

### Completeness 
The data is collected for the entire [Single European Sky Area][ses-area].

## Accuracy and reliability

### Overall accuracy
The accuracy of the indicator can be influenced by the the NSAs and ANSPs interpretation of
the survey questions.

While the JC indicator helps identifying obstacles to impediments to the application of JC,
it does not provide an indication of the magnitude of those obstacles.
The complementary qualitative analysis of the evidence and justifications provided by States
and ANSPs is therefore an important element of the overall assessment. 


## Timeliness and punctuality
### Timeliness

The data refer to the status of JC which was measured the year before its publication.


###  Punctuality
The data is updated by ANSPs and NSAs at least once per year.
The data is then verified by EASA in March of the following year. 



## Comparability
Data are comparable being measured in the same way across European Member States.
However, benchmarking is not allowed in safety. 

### Comparability — geographical
Geographical comparability is valid.

### Comparability over time
Comparisons over time are valid.

## Coherence
### Coherence — cross domain
Not applicable. 

### Coherence — internal
The data is assumed to be internally coherent as provided. 

## Cost and burden

Not available. 


## Data revision

Data could change with time due to two reasons:

* to reflect a change in managing JC within a State or an ANSP,
* to reflect an improved verification. 



## Statistical processing

### Source data

Questionnaires and forms completed by States and ANSPs
(see also the
[Statistical concepts and definitions](#statistical-concepts-and-definitions) section).

The completed tables included in AMC 9 and 10 (optional). 



### Frequency of data collection
After the first completion, ANSPs and NSAs are requested to update the questionnaires
on a yearly basis. 


### Data collection

The State and ANSP questionnaires are collected by EASA though a web application.


### Data validation

EASA verifies the updated questionnaires by March of the following year at the latest.
After EASA verification, the data described are sent to the PRB by March of
the following year at the latest.

The data validation is done as follows:

* During the desktop verification, the consistency between the answer (yes or no),
  the justifications provided and the evidence is evaluated.
* In a second step, the level of JC implementation is verified through external information
  available to EASA, NM and PRB.
  Clarification questions could be addressed to the NSA either via mail or telephone. 

### Data compilation 

Following the verification by EASA, the following data is provided to the PRB:

* the States' completed questionnaires including justifications and evidence;
* the ANSP questionnaires verified by EASA, including justifications and evidence;
* the JC PI computations for each State and each ANSP; and,
* the qualitative analyses on areas of improvements provided by ANSPs, NSAs and
  the ones directly performed by EASA. 

### Adjustment
Not applicable.
