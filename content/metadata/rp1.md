plus Norway and Switzerland (29 States in total).


# Performance Indicators

## SAFETY
### [Application of risk analysis tool (RAT) methodology][arat]
The measure described hereunder determines to what extent the Severity classification based on
the risk analysis tool (RAT) methodology was applied when assessing the severity of a
safety occurrence.

### [Reporting of Just Culture (JC)][rojc]
Reporting of Just Culture (JC) aims at identifying possible obstacles and impediments to
the application of Just Culture.
Just Culture means a culture in which front line operators or others are not punished
for actions, omissions or decisions taken by them that are commensurate with their experience and
training, but where gross negligence, willful violations and destructive acts are not tolerated.

### [Effectiveness of safety management (EoSM)][eosm]
The Effectiveness of Safety Management (EoSM) indicator should be measured by
verified responses to questionnaires at State/competent authority and service provision level.
For each question the response should indicate the level of implementation,
characterising the level of performance of the respective organisation.


## CAPACITY
### [Minutes of en route ATFM delay per flight][merd]
The measure provides an indication of ATFM delays on the ground due to constraints en-route.


### [Airport ATFM delay][aptd]
The measure provides an indication of ATFM delays on the ground due to constraints at airports.


### [Additional time in the Arrival Sequencing and Metering Area (ASMA)][atasma]
The additional ASMA time is a proxy for the average arrival runway queuing time on
the inbound traffic flow, during congestion periods at airports.


### [Additional taxi-out time][atot]
The additional taxi-out time is a proxy for the average departure runway queuing time on
the outbound traffic flow, during congestion periods at airports.


## ENVIRONMENT

### [Horizontal en-route flight inefficiency][herfe]
The measure provides an indication of the flight inefficiency en-route.

### [Effective use of the civil / military airspace structures][eucmil]
The indicators address the effective use of the civil/military airspace structures.


## COST-EFFICIENCY

### Determined Unit Rate for en route Air Navigation Services
The measure addresses the costs for the provision of en-route air navigation services.


### [Terminal air navigation service costs and unit rates][tansc]
The measure addresses the costs for the provision of terminal air navigation services.
