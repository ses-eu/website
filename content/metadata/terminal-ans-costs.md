Terminal costs are those related to the provision of the following services:

* airport control services, airport flight information services including
  air traffic advisory services, and alerting services,
* air traffic services related to the approach and departure of aircraft within a
  certain distance of an airport on the basis of operational requirements,
* an appropriate allocation of all other air navigation services components,
  reflecting a proportionate attribution between en-route and terminal services. 

The costs of terminal services are financed by means of terminal charges imposed on
the users of air navigation services and/or other revenues, including cross-subsidies
in accordance with Community law.
