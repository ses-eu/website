<h3>Data description</h3>
<p>The indicators described in this section address the effective use of the civil/military
airspace structures.</p>
<p><a href="https://ansperformance.eu/bibliography/legislation/" title="Legislation">Commission Regulation (EU) No 691 / 2010</a> laying down a performance scheme for
air navigation services and network functions (the “performance regulation”) requires
the monitoring of the effective use of civil/military airspace structures during
the first reference period, with target setting being foreseen for the second reference period.</p>
<p>The performance regulation states in Annex IV that national authorities shall provide data
in support to tasks referred to in Article 4(1 )(m) and (n) of
<a href="https://ansperformance.eu/bibliography/legislation/" title="Legislation">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2150 / 2005 of 23 December 2005</a> laying down common rules
for the flexible use of airspace (FUA).
Furthermore, the performance regulation states that this data shall be provided on an annual basis.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that Article 4(1) (m) and (n) of
<a href="https://ansperformance.eu/bibliography/legislation/" title="Legislation">Commission Regulation (EC) No 2150 / 2005</a> already requires Member States to assess
the performance of flexible use of airspace operations, and archive data on the requests,
allocation and actual use of airspace structures, it is expected that the data required is
already available at a national level, most probably in the Airspace Management Cells, the AMCs.</p>
<p>The intention is to monitor the number of hours that <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/sua/" title="SUA">special use airspace (SUA)</a>
has been reserved for restriction or segregation from general air traffic;
the number of hours that it was subsequently used for such activity.
Additionally, the number of hours that previously reserved airspace were returned for
use by general air traffic, with a notification period of three hours or more, shall be monitored.</p>
<p>The two indicators described above, are known as <a href="../booking-and-release-procedures/" title="Booking and Release Procedures">Booking and Release Procedures</a>.</p>
<p>To balance the performance measurement, we will also report on the
<a href="../utilisation-of-conditional-routes/" title="Utilisation of Conditional Routes">Utilisation of Conditional Routes</a> by general air traffic.</p>

<h3>Statistical unit</h3>
<p><strong>Booking and Release Procedures</strong> are computed for individual Special Use Airspace (SUA).
The individual SUA data is aggregated into an EU wide statistic.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Conditional Routes</strong> is based on the last filed flight plan of each flight,
and on individual CDRs. The individual data is aggregated into an ECAC wide statistic.</p>

<h3>Overall accuracy</h3>
<div id="booking-and-release-procedures-3" class="section level4">
<h4>Booking and Release Procedures</h4>
<p>It is acknowledged that, for many reasons, there will be differences between the actual time
of use of an SUA and the recorded time of use.
Such reasons can include safety buffers between the starting time of the booking and
ensuring the area is cleared before commencing activities.
In addition there can be differences due to early termination of the activity without ATC or
the network being informed.
A third source of errors is likely to arise in the process of recording the times,
collating the aggregated times and reporting these to the European Commission via the PRU.
Despite these and similar errors, since this indicator is at such a high level,
it is expected to be sufficiently accurate for its purpose.</p>
</div>
<div id="utilisation-of-conditional-routes-3" class="section level4">
<h4>Utilisation of Conditional Routes</h4>
<p>The metric assumes that the shortest distance is in fact the optimal route.
However, it may be that the optimal route is not that which is shortest in distance,
due to route charges, wind or <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/atfm-delay/" title="ATFM Delay">ATFM delay</a>.
The metric also assumes that the CDR was available at the actual time of flight,
although this metric is calculated post-ops using aggregated data.
Despite these and similar errors, since this indicator is at such a high level,
it is expected to be sufficiently accurate for its purpose.</p>
