A statistical series is said to be expressed in _real terms_ when the values are deflated
relative to a base year. This allows for comparison and analysis of evolutions in volume.

Expressing a statistical series in _real terms_ is an equivalent expression to
_at constant prices_, e.g. at EURO 2009 prices.

This is opposed to the concept of _[Nominal terms][nomterms]_.
