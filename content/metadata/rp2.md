plus Norway and Switzerland (30 States in total).


# Performance Indicators

## SAFETY

### [Effectiveness of safety management (EoSM)][eosm]

The Effectiveness of Safety Management (EoSM) indicator should be measured by
verified responses to questionnaires at State/competent authority and service provision level.
For each question the response should indicate the level of implementation,
characterising the level of performance of the respective organisation.


### [Application of risk analysis tool (RAT) methodology][arat]
The measure determines to what extent the Severity classification based on the
risk analysis tool (RAT) methodology was applied when assessing the severity of a safety occurrence.


### [Reporting of Just Culture (JC)][rojc]

Reporting of Just Culture (JC) aims at identifying possible obstacles and impediments to
the application of Just Culture.
Just Culture means a culture in which front line operators or others are not punished for actions,
omissions or decisions taken by them that are commensurate with their experience and training,
but where gross negligence, willful violations and destructive acts are not tolerated.


## ENVIRONMENT

### [Horizontal en-route flight inefficiency][herfe]

The measure provides an indication of the flight inefficiency en-route.

### [Additional time in the Arrival Sequencing and Metering Area (ASMA)][atasma]
The additional ASMA time is a proxy for the average arrival runway queuing time o
n the inbound traffic flow, during congestion periods at airports.


### [Additional taxi-out time][atot]
The additional taxi-out time is a proxy for the average departure runway queuing time on
the outbound traffic flow, during congestion periods at airports.


### [Effective use of the civil / military airspace structures][eucmil]
The indicators address the effective use of the civil/military airspace structures.



## CAPACITY

### [Minutes of en route ATFM delay per flight][merd]
The measure provides an indication of ATFM delays (resulting from an air traffic management
initiative, i.e. flow regulation) on the ground due to constraints en-route.

### [Airport ATFM delay][aptd]
The measure provides an indication of ATFM delays (resulting from an air traffic
management initiative, i.e. flow regulation) on the ground due to constraints at airports.

### [Adherence to ATFM slots][aslot]
The measure provides an indication of the level of adherence to ATFM slots. 


### [Air traffic control pre-departure delay][atcpd]
The ATC pre-departure delay is the additional time that the aircraft is held at the stand to
avoid queuing at the departure runway.


## COST-EFFICIENCY

### Determined unit cost (DUC) for en route ANS
The measure addresses the costs for the provision of en-route air navigation services.


### Determined unit cost (DUC) for terminal ANS
The measure addresses the costs for the provision of terminal air navigation services.
