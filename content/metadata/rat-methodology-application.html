<h3>Data description</h3>
<p>EU legislation requests EU Member States to use the Severity classification based on the
RAT methodology in order to allow a harmonised reporting of severity assessment of
Separation Minima Infringements, Runway Incursions and ATM Specific Technical Events.</p>

<li><a href="https://easa.europa.eu/system/files/dfu/Annex%20to%20ED%20Decision%202014-035-R.pdf">AMC4 SKPI GENERAL DESCRIPTION</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Severity classification based on the RAT methodology follows the principle of evaluating
several criteria and allocating a certain score to each criterion, depending on how severe
each criterion is evaluated to be.</p>
<p>Each criterion should have a limited number of options with corresponding scores.
Some criteria have an ATM Ground and an ATM Airborne component and both scores should be
counted when evaluating the ATM Overall score.
Other criteria should be only relevant either for ATM Ground or ATM Airborne.</p>
<p>The overall score for severity of an occurrence should be the sum of the scores allocated
to each applicable individual criterion.
The overall score for the severity of an occurrence should be built from the sum of the
score allocated to the risk of collision/proximity (itself a sum of the score allocated
to the separation and the score allocated to the rate of closure) and
the degree of controllability over the incident.</p>
<p>For ATM-specific occurrences (i.e. technical occurrences affecting the capability to
provide safe ATM/ANS services) the criteria which should be considered are the service affected,
service/function provided, operational function, type of failure, extension of the failure and
its scope and duration.</p>
<p>The severity of occurrences reported by Member States should be the ATM Overall severity.</p>
<p>For ATM-specific occurrences, the ATM Overall coincides with ATM Ground severity.</p>
<p>Member States should ensure that arrangements are in place for the ATM Overall severity score to
be reported.</p>

</ul>
<p>The Member States’ points of contact, established in accordance with Directive 2003 / 42 / EC and
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1330 / 2007, should collect verified information regarding the
application of the “Severity classification based on the RAT methodology”for the
reported occurrences within the scope of Commission Regulation (EU) No 691 / 2010 as
amended by Regulation (EU) No 1216 / 2011.</p>
<p>The collection of information relevant to the use of the “Severity classification based on
the RAT methodology”should make use of existing safety data reporting mechanisms with
enhancements where needed.</p>
<p>When the Member States report on the monitoring of the performance plans and targets,
they should report the percentage of occurrences the severity of which has been evaluated by
the use of the RAT methodology.</p>
<p>The following attached graphics are consistent with the EASA AMC/GM material and provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <a href="../../images/marksheet-overview.jpg">overview of the main components of the “Severity classification based on the RAT methodology”</a>; and,</li>
<li>an <a href="../../images/example-of-severity-marksheet.jpg">example of a marksheet to make the severity assessment in accordance with the RAT methodology</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further information is available in the
<a href="https://easa.europa.eu/document-library/agency-decisions/ed-decision-2014035r#SKPI">EASA Acceptable Means of Compliance and Guidance Material (EASA AMC/GM)</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: <strong>Member States could decide to use different means of reporting.</strong>
They could use the <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/ast/" title="AST">AST</a>/ESARR2 data reporting mechanism which is already available.
It should be noted that the European Central Repository (ECR) will remain the central source of
safety information in the EU.
Therefore, compatibility with the ECCAIRS system, the software tool used for the ECR,
is an important criteria.
Member States could decide to report the RAT methodology utilisation through the ECCAIRS 5
custom attribute on nationaml level.
However, the reporting of RAT methodology utilisation through ECR is still under development.
Furthermore, in the near future, States could have the possibility to report aggregate values on
the RAT utilisation methodology via the EASA web-interface.
<strong>A new medata version will be released as soon as there are changes in the reporting mechanisms.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Quality Management</h2>
<p>The legal framework for quality management is established by EU legislation.</p>
<p>The assessment of data quality can be checked through two different practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>The comparison between data reported at the level of individual occurrences (e.g. AST or ECR )
and the aggregated level (e.g. via the EASA website once available).</li>
<li>The monitoring of effective implementation of the “Severity classification based on the
RAT methodology” by EASA and NSAs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The effective use of the <em>“Severity classification based on the RAT methodology”</em>
can be checked through:</p>
<ul>
<li>the on-going compliance audits of NSA on ANSPs;</li>
<li>the standardisation inspections of EASA on Member States.</li>
<li>information available through other sources (PRB, NM, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<div id="quality-assurance" class="section level3">
<h3>Quality assurance</h3>
<p>The following information could be checked in the framework of quality assurance:</p>
<ul>
<li>the complete list of all entities which are mandated to conduct investigations for
incidents less than serious;</li>
<li>the availability of tools to implement the “Severity classification based on the RAT methodology”
in each entity which are mandated to conduct investigations;</li>
<li>the availability of qualified and trained staff to use the RAT methodology and tools;</li>
<li>samples of incidents whose severity has been assessed with the RAT methodology; and,</li>
<li>the demonstration that the RAT methodology utilisation to assess severity is properly
reported with one of the possible means (e.g. through <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/ast/" title="AST">AST</a>/ESARR2).</li>
