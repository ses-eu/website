<h3>Data description</h3>
<p>The measure provides an indication of <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/atfm-delay/" title="ATFM Delay">ATFM delays</a> on the ground due to
constraints en-route.</p>
<p>In accordance with EU legislation, <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/ses-area/" title="SES Area">Single European Sky Area</a> States are required to
adopt performance targets contributing adequately to and be consistent with the EU wide targets.
The capacity <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/kpi/" title="KPI">KPI</a> for the first <a href="#reference-period">reference period</a> is the
<a href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/atfm-delay/" title="ATFM Delay"><em>en route ATFM delay per flight</em></a>.</p>
<p>In Europe, when traffic demand is anticipated to exceed the available capacity in en route centres
or at airports, Air Traffic Control (ATC) units may request the local
Flow Management Position (<a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/fmp/" title="FMP">FMP</a>) to instigate an Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) measure,
or regulation.
Aircraft expected to arrive during a period of congestion are given Air Traffic Flow Management
delay at their departure airport, under the authority of the <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/nm-cfmu/" title="NM">Network Manager</a>,
in order to regulate the flow of traffic into the constrained downstream en route sector or airport,
thus ensuring safety.
The resulting ATFM delays are calculated as the difference between the estimated take-off time
calculated from the filed flight plan including updates and the calculated take-off time
allocated by the central unit of ATFM.
The reason for the regulation is indicated by the responsible Flow Management Position (FMP).
The delay is attributed to the most constraining ATC unit.</p>
<p><strong>En route ATFM delay</strong> has been in use as a commonly agreed proxy for en route capacity shortfalls
since 1999.
The calculation of ATFM delays is based on a well established and commonly accepted algorithm
and is compliant with the <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/kpi/" title="KPI">KPI</a> definition in the EU legislation.</p>
</div>
<div id="classification-system" class="section level3">
<h3>Classification system</h3>
<p>En route ATFM delay per flight is classified per <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/ansp/" title="ANSP">Air Navigation Services Provider</a>
and per <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/fab/" title="FAB">Functional Airspace Block</a> within the <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/ses-area/" title="SES Area">Single European Sky Area</a>.</p>
<p>For the monitoring of National/FAB Performance targets, the performance of the <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/ansp/" title="ANSP">ANSP</a>
designated as the accountable entity in the performance plan is considered.
This is extended to a group of <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/ansp/" title="ANSP">ANSP</a>s in the case of a <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/fab/" title="FAB">FAB</a>
