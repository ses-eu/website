<h3>Data description</h3>
<p>The <strong>additional ASMA time</strong> is a proxy for the average arrival runway queuing time on the
inbound traffic flow, during congestion periods at airports.</p>
<p>It is the difference between the actual ASMA time of a flight and a statistically determined
<a href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/unimpeded-asma-time/" title="Unimpeded ASMA Time">unimpeded ASMA time</a> based on ASMA times in periods of low traffic demand (see also
<a href="https://ansperformance.eu/methodology/unimpeded-asma-time/" title="Unimpeded ASMA Time - Methodology">unimpeded ASMA time - Methodology</a>).</p>
<p>Uncertainty of approach conditions (e.g. pilot performance, landing clearance time, approach speed, wind conditions) makes traffic supply to runways a stochastic phenomenon. In order to ensure continuous traffic demand at runways and maximise runway usage, a minimum level of queuing is required. However, additional time in holding is detrimental to operations efficiency, fuel consumption and environment. Therefore, there exists a trade-off between approach efficiency and runway throughput.</p>
<p>As an output of the ATMAP Group, the additional ASMA time PI has been in use as a commonly agreed proxy for airport inefficiencies in the approach phase since 2008 and is compliant with the <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/kpi/" title="KPI">KPI</a> definition in EU legislation.</p>

<div id="statistical-concepts-and-definitions" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical concepts and definitions</h3>
<p>The <strong>Arrival Sequencing and Metering Area (ASMA)</strong> is defined as a virtual cylinder with a
40-NM radius around the airport.
The actual time spent by a flight between its last entry in the cylinder
(Entry-time at 40 NM upstream) and the actual landing time (ALDT) is denoted <strong>ASMA transit time</strong>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/unimpeded-asma-time/" title="Unimpeded ASMA Time">Unimpeded ASMA time</a> is determined for each group of flights with the same parameters
(i.e. aircraft class, ASMA entry sector, arrival runway) and represents the transit time
in non congested conditions.</p>
<p>The <strong>Additional ASMA time</strong> is the difference between the actual ASMA transit time and
the unimpeded ASMA time calculated for non-congested conditions.</p>
