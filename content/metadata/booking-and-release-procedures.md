The indicator "Booking and Release Procedures" monitors the actual use of [SUAs][sua]
compared to the number of hours that they were notified as being restricted or
segregated from general air traffic.

It is compiled using the number of hours that [shared use airspace (SUA)][sua]
has been reserved for restriction or segregation from general air traffic;
the number of hours that it was subsequently used for such activity.

Additionally, the number of hours that previously reserved airspace were returned for
use by general air traffic, with a notification period of three hours or more, is monitored.
