## Statistical presentation

### Data description

#### ref. EASA Annex to ED Decision 2014 / 035 / R

##### AMC1 SKPI 

_GENERAL DESCRIPTION_: The Effectiveness of Safety Management (EoSM) indicator should be
measured by verified responses to questionnaires at State/competent authority and
service provision level.
For each question the response should indicate the level of implementation,
characterising the level of performance of the respective organisation.

A Management Objective (MO) has been derived for each of the elements of the
ICAO State Safety Programme (SSP) and Safety Management System (SMS) as
described in ICAO Document 9859 ‘Safety Management Manual’.


_EFFECTIVENESS LEVELS AND EFFECTIVENESS SCORE_: When answering the questions,
one of the following levels of implementation should be selected:

- Level A which is defined as ‘Initiating’ — processes are usually ad hoc and chaotic;
- Level B which is defined as ‘Planning/Initial Implementation’ — activities,
  processes and services are managed;
- Level C which is defined as ‘Implementing’ — defined and standard processes are used for managing;
- Level D which is defined as ‘Managing & Measuring’ — objectives are used to manage processes and
  performance is measured;
- Level E which is defined as ‘Continuous Improvement’ — continuous improvement of processes and
  process performance.


#### ref. EASA Annex to ED Decision 2014 / 035 / R

* AMC2 SKPI — Questionnaire for Measurement of Effectiveness of Safety Management KPI — State level
* AMC3 SKPI — Questionnaire for Measurement of Effectiveness of Safety Management SKPI — ANSP level

For each question, States should provide to the Agency information on the level of
effectiveness (or level of implementation) and evidence to justify their answer.
For each question, ANSPs should provide to their NSA/competent authority information on
the level of effectiveness (or level of implementation) and evidence to justify its answer.


#### ref. EASA Annex to ED Decision 2014 / 035 / R

The results of the States’ filled-in questionnaires are to be verified by means of
EASA standardisation inspections.

The coordination between EASA and the competent authority should be done through
the national coordinator appointed by the State in accordance with Article 6 of
Commission Regulation (EC) No 736 / 2006.

The national coordinator should be responsible for coordination within the State authorities
and for coordination with the ANSPs to provide the Agency with the responses to the
questionnaires (both competent authority and ANSP, aggregated where required).

The competent authority/NSA may allocate the detailed verification task to a qualified entity
or other entity.

The verification of the ANSP questionnaires by the NSA/competent authority should take place
before the questionnaires and their results are submitted to EASA.
ANSPs should assign a focal point for the purpose of the verification process.

A detailed description of the EoSM indicator and data requirements are available from the
[EASA Acceptable Means of Compliance and Guidance Material (EASA AMC/GM)](http://easa.europa.eu/system/files/dfu/Annex%20to%20ED%20Decision%202014-035-R.pdf#SKPI).
