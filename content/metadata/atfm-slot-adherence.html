<h3>Data description</h3>
<p>ATFM departure slots are allocated centrally by the European Network Manager upon the request
of the local Flow Management Position (FMP), when an imbalance between demand and capacity is
foreseen at airports and/or en-route.
The purpose of such regulation is to hold aircraft on the ground.</p>
<p>An ATFM slot tolerance window is available to ATC to sequence departures.
The standard slot tolerance window is [-5 minutes, +10 minutes].
ATC at the departure airport has a joint responsibility with aircraft operators to ensure that
flights departure within the allocated ATFM slot tolerance window in order to optimise traffic flow.
ATFM departure slot adherence, simply named <strong>ATFM slot adherence</strong> hereafter,
measures the share of take-offs inside the slot tolerance window of [-5 minutes, +10 minutes].</p>
<p>ATFM slot adherence monitoring is a pre-requisite to fine tune traffic predictions
at the departure, en-route airspace and at the destination airports.
The higher the number of regulated departing aircraft inside the assigned ATFM standard window,
the more accurate the predicted traffic and associated down-stream ATFM measures.</p>
<p>ATFM slot adherence monitoring is required by SES legislation.
The ATS units are required to provide the information regarding non-compliance to slot adherence
for these airports where non-adherence equals or exceeds 20% of the regulated departures, as well
as their action plans to mitigate such a non-compliance.</p>
<p>The Network Manager monitors ATFM slot adherence on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>The legislation also requires
ATFM slot adherence to be monitored at local level, i.e. at national level with a breakdown
at airport level.</p>

<h3>Data compilation</h3>
<p>The departure time of a regulated flight is inside the slot tolerance window when its
Actual Take-off time (ATOT) is in a window starting 5 minutes before and ending 10 minutes after
its Calculated Take-Off time (CTOT), i.e.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[CTOT – 5 min &lt;= ATOT &lt;= CTOT + 10 min \]</span></p>
<p>It should be acknowledged that the exceptional extension of the standard
ATFM slot tolerance window [-5 minutes, +10 minutes], as described in the ATFCM User Manual
under 4.6.4 “Adverse Operating Conditions at Aerodromes”, is not taken into account in the
calculation of ATFM slot adherence.
These exceptions represent in most cases less than 2% of regulated flights.</p>
<p>The adherence to ATFM slots determines the percentage of regulated flights with an ATOT
inside the slot tolerance window.</p>
<p>The Actual Take-Off time of a flight can be determined when the NM received
an ATC activation message from its departure airport.
Therefore, the assessment is made only for those flights for which an activation message
at the origin airport (FSA message) or a Departure message (DEP) is available.</p>
