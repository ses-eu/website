service providers certified to provide air traffic services. This KPI measures the level of 
implementation of the following safety management objectives:

* (b) The rate of separation minima infringements at Union level with a safety impact

## 2. ENVIRONMENT 
### 2.1 Key performance indicators
The average [horizontal en-route flight efficiency][herfe] of the actual trajectory, calculated as follows:
* (a) the indicator is the comparison between the length of the en route part of the actual trajectory derived from surveillance data and the achieved distance, summed over IFR flights within or traversing the airspace as defined in Article 1, hereinafter referred to as ‘European airspace’;

* (b) ‘en route part’ refers to the distance flown outside a circle of 40 NM around the airports;

* (c) where a flight departs from or arrives at an airport outside the European airspace, the entry or exit points of the European airspace are used for the calculation of this indicator as the origin or destination respectively, rather than the departure or destination airport;

* (d) where a flight departs from and arrives at an airport inside the European airspace and crosses a non-European airspace, only the part inside the European airspace is used for the calculation of this indicator;

* (e) ‘achieved distance’ is a function of the position of the entry and exit points of the flight into and out of each portion of airspace for all parts of the trajectory. Achieved distance represents the contribution that those points make to the great circle distance between origin and destination of the flight;

* (f) the indicator is calculated for the whole calendar year and for each year of the reference period, as an average. When calculating this average, the ten highest daily values and the ten lowest daily values are excluded from the calculation.

### 2.2 Indicators for monitoring

* (b) The average [horizontal en-route flight efficiency][herfe] of the shortest constrained trajectory

* (c) The effective use of reserved or segregated airspace calculated as the ratio of the initial requested allocated time for reservation or segregation from general air traffic, and the final allocated time used for the activity requiring such segregation or reservation. The indicator is calculated for all airspace allocations notified to the Network Manager.

* (d) The rate of planning via available airspace structures, including reserved or segregated airspace and conditional routes, for general air traffic calculated as the ratio of aircraft filing flight plans via such airspace structures and the number of aircraft that could have planned through those airspace structures.

* (e) The rate of using available airspace structures, including reserved or segregated airspace, conditional routes, by general air traffic calculated as the ratio of aircraft flying via such airspace structures and the number of aircraft that could have planned through these airspace structures.

  : ‘calculated take-off time’ means the time allocated by the Network Manager on the day of operation, as a result of tactical slot allocation, at which a flight is expected to become airborne;
  : ‘estimated taxi-out time’ means the estimated time between off-block and take off. This estimate includes any delay buffer time at the holding point or remote de-icing prior to take off;

* (d) the average Union-wide DUC for en route air navigation services is calculated in euro and in real terms.

### 4.2 Indicators for monitoring
* The actual unit cost incurred by users separately for en route and terminal air navigation services at Union level, calculated as follows:
