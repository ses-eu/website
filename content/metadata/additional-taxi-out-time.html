<h3>Data description</h3>
<p>The <strong>additional taxi-out time</strong> is a proxy for the average departure runway queuing time
on the outbound traffic flow, during congestion periods at airports.</p>
<p>It is the difference between the actual taxi-out time of a flight and a statistically
determined <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/unimpeded-taxi-out-time/" title="Unimpeded Taxi-out Time">unimpeded taxi-out time</a> based on taxi-out times in periods of
low traffic demand (see also <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/methodology/unimpeded-taxi-out-time/" title="Unimpeded Taxi-out Time - Methodology">related methodology documentation</a>).</p>
<p>Uncertainty of take-off clearance time and aircraft arriving time at runway holding stop bars
makes traffic supply to runways a stochastic phenomenon.
In order to ensure continuous traffic demand at runways and maximise runway usage,
a minimum level of queuing is required.
However, additional time is detrimental to taxi-out efficiency, fuel consumption and environment.
Therefore, there exists a trade-off between taxi-out efficiency and runway throughput.</p>
<p>When monitoring taxi-out performance at airports, it is to be stressed that the goal is
not to reduce taxi time to an unimpeded time - as this could negatively impact
on runway throughput - but rather to reduce additional taxi-out time and associated
fuel burn to the strict minimum.</p>
<p>As an output of the ATMAP Group, additional taxi-out time has been in use as a commonly
agreed proxy for airport inefficiency in the taxi-out phase since 2008 and is compliant
with the <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/pi/" title="PI">PI</a> definition in the EU legislation.</p>
