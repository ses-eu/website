EU Wide Performance Targets RP1 2012-2014

During the first semester of 2010, the PRB, in consultation with Stakeholders,
developed proposals for EU-wide targets.
This resulted in the PRB report
[Proposed EU-wide performance targets for the period 2012-2014 (September 2010)][prb-targets].

On this basis, the European Commission has adopted a [Commission Decision][ec-decision]
setting the EU-wide performance targets and alert thresholds for the period 2012-2014:

* the EU-wide Environment target is a reduction of -0.75% of the route extension in 2014 compared with 2009;
* the EU-wide Capacity target is set at 0.5 minute en-route ATFM delay per flight for the whole year 2014; and
* the EU-wide Cost-efficiency target is a set of three en-route determined unit rates expressed
  in €2009 per service unit: €57.88 in 2012, €55.87 in 2013 and €53.92 in 2014.
