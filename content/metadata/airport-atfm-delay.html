<h3>Data description</h3>
<div class="note">
<p>Please note that software release 20.0 of the Network Manager on 04 April 2016 introduced a
change in the computation of ATFM delay for operational purposes.
ATFM delays on this web page are based on this new computation from 04 April 2016 onwards.
See the Source data section below for more information on the changes in NM release 20.0.</p>
</div>
<p>The measure provides an indication of <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/atfm-delay/" title="ATFM Delay">ATFM delays</a> on the ground due to constraints
at airports.</p>
<p>In Europe, when traffic demand is anticipated to exceed the available capacity in en route centres
or at airports, Air Traffic Control (ATC) units may request the local
Flow Management Position (<a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/fmp/" title="FMP">FMP</a>) to instigate an Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) measure,
or regulation.
Aircraft expected to arrive during a period of congestion are given Air Traffic Flow Management
delay at their departure airport, under the authority of the <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/nm-cfmu/" title="NM">Network Manager</a>,
in order to regulate the flow of traffic into the constrained downstream en route sector or airport,
thus ensuring safety.
The resulting ATFM delays are calculated as the difference between the estimated take-off time
calculated from the filed flight plan including updates and the calculated take-off time
allocated by the central unit of ATFM.
The reason for the regulation is indicated by the responsible Flow Management Position (FMP).
The delay is attributed to the most constraining ATC unit.</p>
<p>As an output of the ATMAP Group, <strong>Airport ATFM delay</strong> has been in use as a commonly agreed proxy
for airport capacity shortfalls since 2009.
The calculation of Airport ATFM delay is based on a well established and commonly accepted
algorithm and is compliant with the <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/kpi/" title="KPI">KPI</a> definition in the EU legislation.</p>

an en route <a href="https://ansperformance.eu/definition/atfm-delay/" title="ATFM Delay">ATFM delay</a> and attributed to airport or en route facilities.
Airport ATFM delays generated by arrival or global regulations are attributed to the
arrival airport as stated in the flight plan.
If the regulation is protecting a group of airports, the delay is attributed to the
destination airport of the affected flight.</p>
<p>Each ATFM regulation also comprises a designator referring to the cause of delay
which can be used in further analysis.</p>
